# Obsidian's Online URL shortener

A simple Obsidian plugin that lets you **right-click any external link** and replace it directly with the response from an public API 

Current API: is.gd

Fully working in Source mode 
Haven not been tested properly on Live Preview and Reading view modes (never need it)

If you want to add your preferred API to the plugin (bit.ly, tinyurl.com, rebrandly.com, short.io, cutt.ly, t.ly, shrtco.de ...etc.), feel free to push a PR
